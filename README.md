# FlexTrainer

# This a compehensive project that covers concepts like Windows Forms, Database and Microsoft SQL Server. We have used these concepts to create a functional,responsive and interactive dekstop app that may be used as a gym management system. We have made sure to cover all the best programming princples with regards to Databases like Normalization and the use of foreign/ surrogate keys wherever necessary. This a testament to our team's collaborative nature and our ability to tackle programming problems in an efficent and timely manner.
